# The Hacky As Fuck Software License
Are you a lawyer? Do you find understanding software licenses a bit difficult? If you answered 'No!!' to the first question and 'Fuck yes!' to the second, you might enjoy using the Hacky As Fuck Software License. This is a work in progress with the aim of being simple and easy to understand. Version 1 reads as follows.

```
This 'ere software is hacky as fuck. Use at your peril.
I'd appreciate a mention if you do. But if you don't,
I'm not going to lose sleep over it.
<Insert your name here> in the year of 2018
```

If you end up using this license, feel free to fork this page, add your contribution and send me a pull request so I can add it to the following list. But if you chose not to, I really couldn't give a fuck.
